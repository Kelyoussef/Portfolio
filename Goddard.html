									<p>	
										The first picture displays the complete rocket ready to fire on the rail. From left to right 
										we can see the carbon fiber wrapped combustion chamber where the solid fuel (ABS) is housed,
										the aluminum oxidizer tank which hold the liquid oxidizer (Nitrous), and the fiberglass 
										forebody (both the green bodytube and balck nose cone) where the instrumentation, avionics, recovery,
										and payload are housed. In the second or post flight picture on the top row the green body tube from 
										the forebody and the aluminum oxidizer tank can be seen, and in the bottom row the carbon fiber 
										wrapper combustion chamber. Unfortunately the nose cone was unable to be recovered due to the shock 
										cord breaking allowing the parachute and nose cone to drift away. The damage seen in the post flight 
										photo can also be attributed to the shock cord breaking, however, the damage was minimal given the rocket
										had to withstand roughly a 45,000 foot fall.

											<h2><b>My Role</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											My roles this year, just as the last two projects, were the avionics lead and 
											lead engineer of the project, however, given the size of the project my responsibilities
											as the Lead Engineer grew dramatically compared to previous years.
											Instead of placing a big focus on solely avionics I spread it over every component and 
                                            designed parts pertaining to every sections of the rocket. In addition, I was also in 
                                            charge of finding, communicating with, and updating sponsors, setting up info-sessions for CAD, CNC, and other softwares, 
											understanding the CNC lathes and mills need to make our parts managing a 5-figure budget (10,000 dollar), and 
                                            filling out the required paperwork for the team, school, System's Go, and making sure 
											everyone on the team has filled out the personal documents allowing us to launch on White Sands Military Base.
											In the following sections I have detailed some of the major component which I designed.

											<h2><b>Mathmatical Model</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Just like the Oberth rocket this project also required a math model, however as this year a 
											requirement is to build our own hybrid engine there was a larger depth to this math model. I have
											included a link to view an earlier stage math model for the project below, the final model is having 
											trouble opening which I will attach as soon as I figure out the issue. Below are some key variable 
											parameters and assumptions that were made in the model (some might not be in the model linked below due 
											to the issue mentioned above)
										</p>
										<p>
											<li>
												Thrust Data: As this year My team and I built our own hybrid engine to which we had a few ways of incorporating its 
												thrust into our models. In my model I had two different methods, the first and easiest was constant thrust and impulse, 
												both roughly estimated from rocket parameters and years of previous data, which I used for mainly for debugging and 
												when a high level of detail was not needed. For the second all hybrid engines follow a similar thrust curve so I used 
												a normalized thrust curve from the Aspire Space Newland's Book and scaled it to match our rocket's parameters.  
											</li>
											<li>
												Ox Tank: Included in the model is an Ox Tank size and stress calculator which is based on material/nitrous properties to 
												calculate the needed length, thickness, and volume of the tank to withstand 1.5 times the maximum operating pressure (1200 psi).
											</li>
											<li>
												Nozzle: Using CEA data, fundamental constants, intial conditions, and a bell nozzle design I built a calculator used to figure out 
												the needed characteristics for the design such as the throat/exit diameter, lengths of the convergent/divergent angles, and the 
												exit velocity.
											</li>
											<li>
												Injector: To ensure an operable mass flow rate is achieved the team built calculators which based on the tank pressure, number of 
												injectors, oriface size, and constants to ensure the constant combustion is acheived.
											</li>

											<h2><b>Avionics</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Design Parameters: 
											<li>
												Launch data, such as velocity, acceleration, alitude, and GPS coordinates must be recorded in the hardware and sent back wirelessly. 
											</li>
											<li>
												The electronics bay must have complete redunacy, meaning no system depended on another and every function can be completed in at least 2 ways. 
												This parameter was based on trying to avoid GPS/Altimeter malfunctions which previous years ran into fairly often.
											</li>
											<li>
												The center of the bay must open for an all-thread to pass through. The purpose of the all thread was to redirect the opening force of the 
												parachute into the ox tank instead of the forebody and electronics bay.
											</li>
											<li>
												To ensure maximum transmit range the bay must be made of all radio-transparent materials (excluding all-threads) and have enough room to make sure no onboard 
												antennas will couple each other. This parameter was based on the projection that after parachute ejection the rocket will drift roughly a mile away from the 
												launch site where our on-ground antennas were set up.
											</li>
										</p>
										<p>
											These parameters culminated in the dicision to have a triangular bay with each side having its own system (system meaning the choosen hardware 
											and needed battery), buying a fiberglass tube to be used as the body, the mounting plates made of ABS sheets and connected with 3D printed supports, 
											and a final length of about 10".

										<span class="imagesquare"><img src="images/CS_CAD_EBay.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>
											The three systems included a Telemetrum, an altimeter capable of transmitting/storing a mutlitude of data and GPS coordinates, a Stratologger CF, 
											another altimeter capable of storing similar data to the Telemtrum, and a GPS, capable of transmitting live alitude and coordinate values to a 
											handheld device. The photos below show all the components used in the assembly of the bay (the right photo) and the state of the components after 
											launch.

											<h2><b>Lathed/Milled Components</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Early in the year I began learning how to CAD and CNC in Solidworks as our sponsor's (Da Vinci Maker Labs)
											machines take the GCode directly from Solidworks software. My primary role here was the generate the CNC code 
											needed for every operation and set up/operate the CNC lathe and mill. Here I learned how to CAD with manufacturing 
											in mind, use solidworks to generate GCode, set coordinate axies, tool offsets, and how to correctly operate CNC machines 
											over a range of materials and speeds with a tolerance of 土.005". 
											<br></br>
											Components Made with CNC: Aluminum Upper and Lower Ox Tank Heads, Graphite Nozzle, Steel Coupler Ring.

											Photo Descriptions: The left photo shows completed outside face of the upper ox tank head inside the machine in a position ready 
											for the boring operation to create a spherical head so better distribute the pressure inside the tank. The right photo shows the 
											fully completed graphite nozzle with o-ring grooves and bell geometry visible.

												<h2><b>Fuel Grain Testing</b></h2>
											</header>
											<p>
												As stated before a major component of this project was the research and construction of a hybrid engine designed completed by 
												the team. Along with my models another area in which I helped was in the testing of different fuel types and design/making a 
												test stand capable of measuring thrust using load cells. 
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="spotlight">
										<div class="content">
											<p>
												Before making the full sized fuel grain we test a range of materials, including HTPB, parasol, and ABS. The video and picture below
												show a test conducted with ABS and the resulting regression made from a cylindrical port. ABS was also ultimately choosen as the material 
												to use in the final rocket. ABS was choosen due reliably combustion with nitrous and its ability to be 3D printed allowing us to easily 
												use a complex port geometry. The final fuel grain weighted roughly 22lbs, 31" long, and was printed in five sections each taking about 
												20 hours of print time.

										</div>	
									</div>
									<div class="spotlight">
										<div class="content">
											<p>
												While the testing fuel grains provides very valuable visual, fuel regression, and nitrous flow rate data the years of rockets 
												before us have never measured thrust data. To solve this issue I contacted an expert in load cells at manufacturing company in my 
												area to give advice and help me build a working model. The set up is seen in the photo to the right, where the top cylinder is where 
												the fuel is housed with the flame cone leaving from the top, the box is used to hold the cylinder, and then there is the scale under 
												everything which measures the thrust created from the fuel. The scale uses a load cell to measure the thrust by converting changes in 
												resistance due to the deformation of the internal cicuit to a force in Newtons. This data is then sent through the wires to a screen not 
												shown in the photo that displays the values during the test and saves them to a excel spreadsheet.

											<h2><b>World Record</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											While the main and offical goal of the Goddard Rocketry Project is to launch a rocket with a self-made engine and payload to an alitude of 50,000 feet, 
											completing them also results in another acomplishment, the world record for the highest altitude reached by highschool student lead researched and designed 
											rocket. The preivous record was about 35,000 feet and stood for 15 years before my team and I came and reached a final alitude of 49,523 feet ASL. This record 
											has since been confirmed by the military, circulated through news channels/other online videos, and referenced in offical Texas government legislative resolutions.

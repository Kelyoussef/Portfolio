                            The Oberth or Transonic level of the Systems Go curriculum, students are tasked with breaking the sounds barrier while 
                            remaining under 13,000 feet with a given budget of 900 dollars. Below is a link to the post mission analysis.

											<h2><b>My Role</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											My roles for this project matched that of my previous year again being the avionics lead and 
											lead engineer of the project. As the avionics lead I chose and programmed the electroincs 
											(e.g. altimeters, GPSs), designed and constructed the electronics bay, and completed any 
											necessary testing (e.g. vacuum chambers, battery life). As the Lead Engineer my roles included
											all those of the previous year, but expand into making the final decisions on the structural
											components of the rocket, as weight, length, and diamter had a greater importance in the 
											design of this rocket. In the following sections I have detailed some of the major component which I designed.

											<h2><b>Mathmatical Model</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											At the begining of the year to help in our design we built a mathmatical model to simulate
											the flight of a rocket with any given parameters. Not only was this meant to prepare us with 
											modeling skills needed for the Goddard Project, but it also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding 
											of the forces that dictate rocket flight and some small changes in the intial conditions can have massive 
											impacts across a long time scale. Below are some key variable parameters and assumptions that were made in the model.
										</p>
										<p>
											<li>
												Linearly decreasing Mass: By dividing the propellant mass by the flow rate I am able to model
												the average amount of propellant that burns away for any given time interval.
											</li>
											<li>
												Variable Drag Coefficient: Using programs such as RASAero I was able to input the rocket parameters
												and receive the drag coefficient for any given speed (in mach) and if the engine is on or off. The less
												detailed solution would be to use a constant drag coefficient just based on the shape of the rocket. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Parachute Expansion: While assuming instant expansion during any parachute deployments reduced complexity 
												it increases inaccuracies in drag and other subsequent values. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Thrust Data: For this project we purchased a L550 motor from Hypertek which came with a thrust curve as a
												varaible of time that I incorporated into my model. Another less detailed method of incorporating thrust into
												the model us have a constant thrust equal to the average of the choosen motor (550N for our choosen motor).
											</li>

											<h2><b>Avionics</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											What made this year special for my journey in avionics was the strict dimensions I had to adhere too. Given the alitude 
											ceiling of 13,000' our highest priority was saving length and weight whenever possible of which the electronics bay was 
											relatively the easiest place to do so. At a final length of 5" and diamter of 3" it could fit in the palm of your hand and 
											is about the same cross section as some phones. However, inside it housed two batteries, an altimeter, GPS, wires,  
											priming hardware, and two custom made mounts to make this all possible. This is the year where I really refined my CAD skills 
											as I would spend hours a day modeling, 3D printing, and editing repeating this process for months as I continued to find ways of 
											reducing weight and length.

											<h2>Assembly Photo</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The electronics bay consisted of one central sled, which on one side a Stratologger CF altimeter was mounted and on the other an Eggfinder GPS. 
											In the photo shown on the right the former side is shown where the battery is inside the 3D printed piece and the altimeter 
											is mounted on top (the GPS and its respective battery were mounted in the same way, except with a different 3D printed piece). 
											The photo also shows our design choice of using a minimal amount of metal to ensure the best radio-transparency which was acheived 
											by using a fiberglass sled and bulkead and rubber bolts.

											<h2>Aftermath</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Shown here is the post-flight photo of the bay after withstanding roughly a 10,000' fall with no parachute. While everything looks broken, 
											everything actually survived except for the 3D printed pieces which were made of PLA and not meant to be structural.

											<h2><b>Launch Day Story</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											While not my biggest rockery project I would argue that this one has the coolest story as well as having the perfect moment to 
											prepare me for anything that can come way. On launch day after a year of research, design, and construction all that was left was 
											for my team and I to watch the flight of our hardwork. However, while filling the nitrous tank due to a procedural error out of 
											our control our rocket broke through the restraints and launch prematruely. Flying 25 feet into the air and crashing down onto the 
											launch pad our body tube, nose cone, rail guides, and avionics all had to be redone, replaced, or fixed. As said before one of my 
											roles was to be the lead engineer, but throughout the year it was never anything more than a title. We all worked together and 
											were committed to the successful completion of our rocket. However, in this moment instead of becoming demoralized and giving up, 
											I quickly gathered my team, spending the next three hours with limited materials and in the middle of nowhere fixing a rocket made 
											completely in a lab setting. In the end it was all worth it as we watched it take flight (for the second time) and having a succesful 
											and stable launch. This day didn’t just show my engineering ability, but who I am under pressure. When everything went wrong, 
											I didn’t let it stop me from completing what I had gone to do. Through all the confusion and anger, I still had the ability to inspire my team.

											<h2>Bandaids</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Accompanying this inspiring story are also pictures which show that even under stressful situations jokes are still possible and that no 
											matter what we had fun doing what we love. One such picture is us placing bandaids on the broken parts of our rocket as why stop with an 
											improvised kevlar pulp composite epoxy when bandaids are amazing for structural integrity.

											<h2><b>Results</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Unfortunately during the repacking of the parachutes after the pre-mature launch they were inserted to tightly to where the onboard ejection 
											charge was not enough anymore to push the parachute out. Due to this the spike in pressure between the parachute and electronics bay broke the 
											seal allowing way to much airflow into the bay which messed with the barometric readings from the altimeter. However, we do have evidence to 
											prove that the sounds barrier was broken during the launch. One of which is that our rocket reached an altitude of over 10,000 feet. All previous 
											Oberth level rockets that have broken the sound barrier have reached this threshold as well and it is seen as a soft requirement to do so. Another is 
											video frame analysis to find the acceleration and velocity of the rocket in early stages of flight. Using videos taken of the launch and counting the 
											pixels traveled per frame we found that the starting acceleration adn velocity matched that of our models with an error of less than 5%. With our models 
											projecting a top speed of mach 1.07 we are within the bounds.

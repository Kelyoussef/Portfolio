						<h1>Princeton Electric Propulsion and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory Research</h1>
						<p>
							In conjuction with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Princeton Electric Propulsion Lab 
							is developing a Lithium-Lorentz Force thruster (A type of Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster)
							with a power output of 30 kiloWatts in hopes to scale to power output to number upward of 250
							kiloWatts.

												One problem with electric propulsion is figuring out when onset voltage occurs. This happens
												when the propellant mass flow rate drops below a critical level, which causes the thruster to 
												self erode. This phenomena is also characterizes by large voltage oscillations, anode material 
												breaking off, and the formation of electric arcs. One method used by the lab to figure out 
												exactly when this occurs is placing a camera inside the pressure tank with the thruster as to 
												find a visual signal for the event. However, an issue arises when trying to maintain a clear 
												view of the thruster due to exiting Lithium solidifying on the lens. To combat this the camera 
												was placed in a box with a constant stream of mylar passing by the camera to ensure a constant 
												unobstructed view. This system however while effective is now seven years old so I was tasked with 
												learning how it works and then to fix/optimize it. 
												<br></br>
												After reading the paper written by the person who made it and taking it apart to get a physical sense for it, 
												partnered with a graduate student we began drawing up new plans and testing the components to see what is still usable. 
												We have since bought new microcontrolers and motors and cuncluded that we can use a different drive train for the mylar 
												stream, remove some redunant layers whose protection is not needed, and then instead of everything being wireless and powered 
												by numerous battery packs the system can just branch off the power line in the tank for the thruster and use a pre-existing port 
												for a wired connection to the computer used for data analysis.

											<li>
												To finish an MPD thruster capable of using Lithium the team first need to machine copper parts to use for directing the flow 
												of the ionized lithium. Because of my previous experience with CNC in combination with all components being designed in Creo 
												I am tasked with manufacturing these parts using both CNC and manual milling.
											</li>
											<li>
												To keep the Lithium pure and ensure its safe use the team only works with it while under a vacuum. Currently our vacuum 
												glove box is not fully operable and working under a senior trying we are currently trying to refurbish it, with my role 
												being to help with testing and installing new parts.

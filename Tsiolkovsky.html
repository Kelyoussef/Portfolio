					    <p>
					    	The Tsiolkovsky or 1 pound/1 mile project, students must bring a 1lb payload to a alitude of one mile with a budget of 
							1,000 dollars. As the introduction year and my first major project my time was spent learning the basics to 
                            different stages of flight, how to effectively do research, lead a team, and accurately and confidently present 
                            information to peers and experts.

                                            Having two major roles this year the first one was the Avionics Lead. This tasked me with choosing and programming the 
                                            altimeter, payload, and any supporting equipment and electronics. In addition, I modeled, prototyped, and constructed 
                                            the avionic and payload bays and conducted any necessary testing along the way.

                                            My other role was as the Lead Engineer, this meant that I oversaw the entire project and along with my concentrate in avionics, 
                                            I assisted in the production of every compoenent, ensured that the team remained on schedule, all necessary paperwork was filled out, 
                                            planned in and out of school hours meetings, and managed the 1,000 dollar budget.

                                            For the avionics, I ultimately decided on using the RRC3 Sport altimeter as its dual-deployment, 40,000 feet ceiling, and a wide range 
                                            of measurement capabilities it was the perfect altimeter for the project and for a base for my altimeter knowledge. To house it, along 
                                            with a 9V battery for power and priming harward I built a 8" long, 4" diameter bay out of blue tube and fiberglass bulkheads, using aluminum 
                                            all-threads and nuts to hold everything together and 3D printed mounting harware made with TPU to hold the parts in place. 
                                            <br></br>
                                            For the payload I decided on mounting a Go Pro Camera in the rocket to record the flight as not only did I think it would be an amazing experience 
                                            to see what the rocket does, but I can also analyze the footage to see if the compoenent preformed as anticipated. For the bay I made it out of a 
                                            polycarbonate tube and 3D printed couplers out of PLA to hold the tube inline with the surrounding blue tube.

                                    My first go at designing at designing an electronics bay so optimization was not the biggest priority yet. 
                                    With the final design being 8" long and 4" in diamter to only house a battery, RRC3 Sport altimeter, and priming hardware 
                                    I was not as worried about reducing weight and length as I was with understand the functionality of every piece and ensuring I 
                                    had the space to experiment. Another goal during this project was to learn how to 3D print for both prototyping and flight-worthy 
                                    parts. Some examples of how I did this was use TPU to create a casing for the battery allowing it to be mounted to the plate and 
                                    using PLA to create adapters allowing the all-threads spaning the bay to connect to the sled.
                                    
                                    In addition, I modeled (in Fusion 360), prototyped (using 
                                    3D printing), and constructed (using 3D printing, blue tubes from Apogee Rockets, polycarbonate tubes, and fiberglass sheets) 
                                    the avionic and payload bays. Furthermore, I planned, set up, and completed any testing along the way including pressure testing, 
                                    radial strength, and battery life.

                                            After retrieving the rocket using the altimeter data we know that the rocket reached a final alitude of roughly half a mile even though 
                                            simulations gave numbers closer much closer to the mile mark. We expect this discrepancy to have been caused by only a third of our fuel 
                                            grain burning. This was a common experience between many other teams as well, and upon emailing the supplier of these motors with this inquiry 
                                            they refused to elaborate on why this could be happening and said they would investigate. Furthermore, our payload of an onboard camera recored 
                                            a video with a higher quality and better view then expected, unfortunately I am unable to find the video.

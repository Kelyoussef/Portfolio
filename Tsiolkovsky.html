					    <p>
					    	The Tsiolkovsky or 1 pound/1 mile level of the Systems Go curriculum, students are 
							tasked with bringing a one pound payload to an altitude of one mile with a given budget of 1,000 dollars. Painted in 
							red and black it reached a altitude of roughly 4000 feet and included an on board camera which 
							recorded the entire flight. Below is a link to the post mission analysis.

                                            I had two major roles this year, one as the avionics lead and the other as the lead 
                                            engineer for the entire project. As the avioincs lead I was tasked with choosing and 
											programming the altimeter, choosing the camera, designing both the electronic and 
											camera bays, and completeing any necessary testing. As the lead engineer I made sure
											the project was always on schedule, all paperwork for the rocket was filled out, planned
											meetings to take place in and out of school hours, and mananged the 1,000 dollar budget.

                                            My first go at designing at designing an electronics bay so optimization was not the biggest priority yet. 
                                            With the final design being 8" long and 4" in diamter to only house a battery, RRC3 Sport altimeter, and priming hardware 
                                            I was not as worried about reducing weight and length as I was with understand the functionality of every piece and ensuring I 
                                            had the space to experiment. Another goal during this project was to learn how to 3D print for both prototyping and flight-worthy 
                                            parts. Some examples of how I did this was use TPU to create a casing for the battery allowing it to be mounted to the plate and 
                                            using PLA to create adapters allowing the all-threads spaning the bay to connect to the sled.

                                            After retrieving the rocket using the altimeter data we know that the rocket reached a final alitude of roughly half a mile even though 
                                            simulations gave numbers closer much closer to the mile mark. We expect this discrepancy to have been caused by only a third of our fuel 
                                            grain burning. This was a common experience between many other teams as well, and upon emailing the supplier of these motors with this inquiry 
                                            they refused to elaborate on why this could be happening and said they would investigate. Furthermore, our payload of an onboard camera recored 
                                            a video with a higher quality and better view then expected, unfortunately I am unable to find the video.

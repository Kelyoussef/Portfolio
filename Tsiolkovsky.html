					    <p>
					    	The Tsiolkovsky or 1 pound/1 mile level of the Systems Go curriculum, students are 
							tasked with bringing a one pound payload to an altitude of one mile with a given budget of 1,000 dollars. Painted in 
							red and black it reached a altitude of roughly 4000 feet and included an on board camera which 
							recorded the entire flight. Below is a link to the post mission analysis.

                                            I had two major roles this year, one as the avionics lead and the other as the lead 
                                            engineer for the entire project. As the avioincs lead I was tasked with choosing and 
											programming the altimeter, choosing the camera, designing both the electronic and 
											camera bays, and completeing any necessary testing. As the lead engineer I made sure
											the project was always on schedule, all paperwork for the rocket was filled out, planned
											meetings to take place in and out of school hours, and mananged the 1,000 dollar budget.

						<h1>Wing Project</h1>
						<p>
							This was the final project for my engineering design class which culminated of material research and comparison, 
							stress analysis, CAD, and milling (both manual and CNC). The goals of the project were to construct the 
							lightest wing possible, with minimum span of 23 inches, while also minimizing delfection under a 90 pound load.

											<h2><b>Simulation and Analysis</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											One of my roles was to assist in the simulation and analysis of the wing, which was completed in Creo Parameteric 10. 
											This consisted of running programs of different wing shapes and internal structures and comparing results to figure 
											out which is the best for our given requirements.

											<h2>Non-Linear Taper</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											A non-linear taper made of three cross-sections (placed at the ends and center) was used to create the I-beam tall in the center 
											increasing its moment of inertia and in return decreasing stree in the center while also allowing the team to use a thinner 
											material, lightening the beam. This was further proved in our simulations which showed that stress were well-spread throughout the 
											entire length of the beam. The skin stresses across the beam generally remained between 50 and 59 ksi, which is comfortably in the 
											bounds of the yield stress of 7075 aluminum.

											<h2>Web Design</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											To help lighten the beam a pattern of circles and triangular trusses were used in the web of the beam. The triangular trusses were used 
											on the thicker end and keep going until they became small enough to match the minmum radii of the avaible tools (1/8), from then on circles 
											were used. This pattern was choosen for the high strength-to-weight ratio allowing the beam to hold the 90lbs while being as light as possible.

											<h2>Deflection</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											During the design of the beam we decided to trade off deflection for weight, but made an effort to stay under a simulated deflection of 4 inches. 
											With a final simulated value of 3.9 inches we decided it was reasonable as our models did not included the skin which will help drastically in reducing 
											deflection.

											<h2><b>Milling Operations</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Another one of my roles consisted of generating the GCode needed to run the CNC mill, which I completed in Creo Parametric 10 and the 
											process consisted of two programs, the first to shape the top, left, and right surfaces and the second to shape the bottom. The 
											second of which is shown in the video on the right. Along with modeling the process in CAD I had to set up the mill by inputing 
											the coordinate axes, zeroing and inputting tool offsets, and correctly securing the stock beam.

											<h2>CNC Milling</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Due to the beam having a tapered cross section a traditional clamp can not be used, to resolve this issue screw holes were pre-drilled 
											in the stock allowing it to be directly connected to the surface in the mill. This is (partially) visible in the right photo where 
											it seems like the stock aluminum is resting on the surface, however it is held in place. The left photo is a picture of the machines screen 
											which relays the feeds, speeds, part of the GCode is visible, and more.

											<h2>Manual Milling</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The final step in the manufacturing of the wing was to manually mill everything that the CNC mill could not get, this included 
											the fixture used to hold the beam during testing, parts of the web which are smaller than 1/8" radius, and a few small quality 
											cuts for weight reduction. In the photo to the right the beam is visble set up in the manual mill in its post-CNC state before 
											these final tweaks.

											<h2><b>Testing</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The test consited of place six increasing loads (65, 90, 115, 140, 165, and 180 in lbs) on the end of the beam. To pass the test the beam 
											must hold 90lbs without fracture or plastic deformation. Our final beam weighted in at 1 lb, 3.9 oz and under the 90lb load had a deflection 
											of 3.25" and once remvoed returned to its orginal shape. As the laod increased the beam began to plastically deform, ultimately fracturing at 
											180lbs. Ultimately, the beam deflection was relatively consistent with what the simulations predicted, with bending being distributed along 
											the length of the beam. The beam fractured near the fixed support, which is consistent with the fact that the moment at the fixed support 
											is largest and thus produces the highest normal stresses. Since aluminum is a ductile material, it first began to neck and finally fractured 
											in the direction of the highest shear stresses, which arise from normal stresses when the coordinate system is rotated by 45 degrees. Tensile 
											stresses reached a yield criterion first, as the beam did not buckle significantly.

						<h1>Wing Project</h1>
						<p>
							This was the final project for my engineering design class which culminated of material research and comparison, 
							stress analysis, CAD, and milling (both manual and CNC). The goals of the project were to construct the 
							lightest wing possible, with minimum span of 23 inches, while also minimizing delfection under a 90 pound load.

											<h2>Simulation and Analysis</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											One of my roles was to assist in the simulation and analysis of the wing, which was completed in Creo Parameteric 10. 
											This consisted of running programs of different wing shapes and internal structures and comparing results to figure 
											out which is the best for our given requirements.

											<h2>CNC/Manual Milling Operations</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Another one of my roles consisted of generating the GCode needed to run the CNC mill, which I completed in Creo Parametric 10 and the 
											process consisted of two programs, the first to shape the top, left, and right surfaces and the second to shape the bottom. The 
											second of which is shown in the video on the right. Along with modeling the process in CAD I had to set up the mill by inputing 
											the coordinate axes, zeroing and inputting tool offsets, and correctly securing the stock beam.

										<p>
											Due to the beam having a tapered cross section a traditional clamp can not be used, to resolve this issue screw holes were pre-drilled 
											in the stock allowing it to be directly connected to the surface in the mill. This is (partially) visible in the right photo where 
											it seems like the stock aluminum is resting on the surface, however it is held in place. The left photo is a picture of the machines screen 
											which relays the feeds, speeds, part of the GCode is visible, and more.

											The final step in the manufacturing of the wing was to manually mill everything that the CNC mill could not get, this included 
											the fixture used to hold the beam during testing, parts of the web which are smaller than 1/8" radius, and a few small quality 
											cuts for weight reduction. In the photo to the right the beam is visble set up in the manual mill in its post-CNC state before 
											these final tweaks.

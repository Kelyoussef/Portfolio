											<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
											<p>
												Born and raised in Lake Jackson, Texas my love for engineering started in elementary school
												with a visit to NASA's Johnson Space center in Houston, where I was captivated by everything
												on display. Since then, needing to understand every compoenent's function, mathmatical moding, 
												and manufacturing process, I have followed a path which led me to build mulitple high-powered 
												rockets, research Electric Propulsion, and much more.

						<h1>Rocketry Projects</h1>
						<p>
							My highschool offered a three year rocketry program under the System's Go curriculum in which students
							are tasked with researching, designing, and constructing three different high-powered rockets each
							with its own goal. Throughout the program in addition to the design process, we built mathmatical and 
							CAD models in Excel, Google Sheets, Fusion 360, and Solidworks. These models were then presented to NASA, Boeing, and 
							other experts to ensure the success of our designs. Below I have detailed the different projects and my 
							roles. Below is a quick overview of all my projects, to be directed to a page with more information click on the box.

					<h1>Research/Design Projects</h1>
					<p>
						Over the past few years I have been part of a couple research and design projects where I was able to apply my skills in propulsion systems, 
						experimental design, data acquisition, CAD, and CNC while also gaining valuable real-world experience, expanding my current knowledge, and learning 
						more about the forces that dictate amazing and fundamental phenomena.

									rocket is currently in. Clicking on this box will take you to a short youtube video of me demoing the project. To see the code
